"add.pl"

This program adds CD info into a simple database. It is essentially a script to mimic the CDDB (CD Database), with one major difference: BPMs. The script reads in the CD title, track titles, track lengths, and track BPM (beats per minute). Then it writes this information to a flat file in the directory that the script occupies.

"bpm.pl"

This program searches all the files in the database for songs with the same BPM.

The webiface folder contains four HTML files that consist of a web interface for the database. Instead of Perl, PHP is used to collect and add info to the db. It is largely unfinished and untested; for instance, no search feature has been implemented yet. It was written to work with sourceforge.net's database, but should adapt to any database with minimal modifications.

I have no plans to work on AID or the web interface in the near future, so if you want to contribute to it's development I invite you to jump in. I realize that ID3v2 has BPM support, so in some ways this program is obsolete, but that's not to say it's not useful for learning. I heavily commented the Perl code to help me learn Perl, so others may benefit from this.
