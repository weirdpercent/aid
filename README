"add.pl"

This program adds CD info into a simple database. It is essentially a
script to mimic the CDDB (CD Database), with one major difference:
BPMs. The script reads in the CD title, track titles, track lengths,
and track BPM (beats per minute). Then it writes this information to a
flat file in the directory that the script occupies.

"bpm.pl"

This program searches all the files in the database for songs with the
same BPM.
